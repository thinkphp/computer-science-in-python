# Recursion

## Introduction

Recursion is a very powerful way yo implement solutions to a certain class of problems. This class of problems is one where the overall solution
to a problem can be generated by breaking that overall problem down into smaller instances of the same problem. The overall result is then
generated by combining together the results obtained for the smaller problems.

## Recursive Behavoir

A recursive solution in a programming language such as Python is one in which a function calls itself one or more times in order to solve
a particular problem. In many cases the result of calling itself is combinated with the functions current state to return a result.

In most cases the recursive call involves calling the function but with a smaller problem to solve. For example, a function to traverse a tree data
structure might call itself passing in a sub-tree to process. Alternatively a function to generate a factorial number might call itself passing in
a smaller number to process.

The key here is thatan overall problem can be solved by breaking it down into smaller  examples of the same problem.
