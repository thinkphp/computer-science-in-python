# Recursion

## Introduction

Recursion is a very powerful way yo implement solutions to a certain class of problems. This class of problems is one where the overall solution
to a problem can be generated by breaking that overall problem down into smaller instances of the same problem. The overall result is then
generated by combining together the results obtained for the smaller problems.

## Recursive Behavior

A recursive solution in a programming language such as Python is one in which a function calls itself one or more times in order to solve
a particular problem. In many cases the result of calling itself is combinated with the functions current state to return a result.

In most cases the recursive call involves calling the function but with a smaller problem to solve. For example, a function to traverse a tree data
structure might call itself passing in a sub-tree to process. Alternatively a function to generate a factorial number might call itself passing in
a smaller number to process.

The key here is thatan overall problem can be solved by breaking it down into smaller  examples of the same problem.


### Recursive Definitions

One of the basic rules for defining new objects or concepts is that the definition should contain only such terms that
have already been defined or that are obvious. Therefore, an object which is defined in terms of itself is a serious violation
of this rule - vicious circle. On the other hand, there are many programming concepts that define themselves. As it turns out, formal
restrictions imposed on definitions such as existence and uniqueness are satisfied and no violation of the rules takes place.
Such definitions are called recursive definitions and are used primarily to define infinite sets. When define sets, it is 
innefficient. Thus, a more efficient efficient way has to be devised to determine if an object belongs to a set.

A recursive definition consists of two parts. In the first part, called the anchor or ground case, the basic elements that are
the building blocks of all elements of the set are listed. In the second part, rules are given that allow for the construction of new
objects out the basic elements or objects that have already been constructed. These rules are applied again and again to generate new objects. For
example, to construct the set of natural numbers, one basic element, 0 is singled out, and the operation of incrementing by 1 is given as:

       1. 0 belongs to N
       2. if n belongs to N, then (n + 1) belongs to N     
       3. there are no other objects in the set N
        
According to these rules, the set of natural numbers N consists of the following items: 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1 + 1, etc
