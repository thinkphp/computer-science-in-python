# Priority Queue

A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements based on their priority values. Elements with higher priority values are typically retrieved before elements with lower priority values.
In a priority queue, each element has a priority value associated with it. When you add an element to the queue, it is inserted in a position based on its priority value.
